Radnor is an application I developed to help me manage stats and finances for my sunday league football team.

It takes advantage of another little application I developed, Starling, which takes retrieves raw Starling bank data and collates it in an easy to process format.

Currently it is a desktop application, written in Python. The UI is written in Tkinter.
