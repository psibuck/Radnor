Project
- fix the continous integration to actually run the tests
- read and load Json instead of text files
- consider iteration cost of iterating match reports/training reports/ players on load

TrainingReport
- add the ability to add training sessions
    - add players to training sessions
    - select venues from dropdown
- ability to remove venues and remove training sessions

Players
- add training attendance to player attributes
- add column headers to home screen and make it a grid(table)
- fix bug where the player reports don't update on home when you make changes

UI
- Table class?
    - takes header list and object properties
- date input?
