Project
- add tests for clearing club data
- set up branching model that requires tests to pass to submit
- strongly type all lists on club
- convert players to be passed around as ids
- add script to deploy to specific folder and also backup stored data
- investigate python testing frameworks, and add tests for src Project
- restructure projects, main logic base should be standalone and testable(currently anything under "src")

FEATURES
- add dummy clubs
- add remove club functionality
- add club image selector
- we need to ask where to store data using filedialog.askdirectory(). Currently if we get a new distribution we lose old data

UI

- fix add venue wizard
- fix add match report wizard


MATCHES

- scoreline should default to 0-0
- can enter anything for goals
- add goals to options in edit match report

EDITING

UX
- add confirm to clear local data button

PLAYERS
- need PlayerProfile
    - stats
    - finances
    - player info
- training credits
- match credits

FINANCES
- add transactions
- edit transactions
- remove transactions

MATCH REPORTS
- add match report wizard ui should be fully data driven from a base match report object that we edit
- subs limit should change depending on match type
- match reports should store the cost of the session in case they change in the interim and we edit the data

CODE CLEAN-up
- don't directly manipulate "training_venues" on club(search training_venues to see issue) can __(double underscore variables to make them private)
- do all of the above for data on club, should all be private
- move magic numbers into data e.g inside financial_utilities

CLUB
- add rules for short name, maybe make club base and extend opponent from it too?
- create club needs some work
- edit club doesn't work

BUGS:
- can select same assister as goalscorer
- no way to navigate off player info page back to the player list
